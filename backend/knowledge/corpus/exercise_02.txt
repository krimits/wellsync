Resistance training should be performed at least 2 days per week targeting all major muscle groups. Use a load that allows 8–12 repetitions per set with good form. Progressive overload — gradually increasing weight or volume — is the primary driver of strength and muscle adaptation. Rest at least 48 hours between sessions targeting the same muscle group.
