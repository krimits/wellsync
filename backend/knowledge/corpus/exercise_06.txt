Aerobic exercise is one of the most effective evidence-based interventions for improving mood and reducing symptoms of anxiety and depression. A single bout of 20–30 minutes at moderate intensity produces immediate mood benefits lasting 1–4 hours, mediated by endorphins, BDNF, and serotonin. Regular aerobic exercise (≥3×/week) has antidepressant effects comparable to medication for mild-to-moderate depression.
