Warming up before exercise and cooling down after are essential for injury prevention and performance. A 5–10 minute dynamic warm-up (leg swings, arm circles, light jogging) prepares muscles and joints by increasing blood flow and tissue temperature. A 5-minute cool-down with static stretching reduces delayed onset muscle soreness (DOMS) and aids parasympathetic nervous system recovery.
