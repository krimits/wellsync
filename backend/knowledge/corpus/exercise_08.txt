Sedentary behavior is independently harmful even for people who meet weekly exercise guidelines. Prolonged sitting (>8 hours/day) is associated with increased all-cause mortality regardless of exercise habits. Breaking up sedentary time with 2–3 minutes of light activity (standing, walking) every 30–45 minutes counteracts many of the metabolic harms of prolonged sitting.
