Low energy availability impairs athletic performance and recovery. When caloric intake is insufficient to support both daily life and training demands, the body enters a catabolic state: muscle protein is broken down for energy, hormone production decreases, and adaptation to training is blunted. Athletes and active individuals should not train fasted for high-intensity sessions lasting more than 60 minutes.
