Carbohydrates are the primary fuel for moderate-to-high intensity exercise. Consuming 30–60 g of fast-digesting carbohydrates (banana, rice, oats) 1–2 hours before a training session improves performance and delays fatigue. For sessions under 45 minutes, pre-workout carbohydrate loading is less critical, but adequate daily carbohydrate intake (3–5 g/kg/day for active individuals) remains important.
