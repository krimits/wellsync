Ultra-processed foods negatively impact energy levels and mood. Diets high in added sugars and refined carbohydrates cause blood glucose spikes and crashes, leading to afternoon energy slumps, irritability, and difficulty concentrating. Prioritizing whole foods — vegetables, legumes, whole grains, lean protein, and healthy fats — stabilizes blood glucose and supports sustained energy throughout the day.
