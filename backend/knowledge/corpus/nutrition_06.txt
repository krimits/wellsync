Caffeine is the most evidence-based legal ergogenic aid. Consuming 3–6 mg of caffeine per kg of body weight 45–60 minutes before exercise improves endurance performance, strength output, and reaction time. However, caffeine consumed after 14:00 significantly disrupts sleep architecture, reducing slow-wave sleep depth even if perceived sleep is unaffected. Limit caffeine intake to morning hours for optimal sleep quality.
