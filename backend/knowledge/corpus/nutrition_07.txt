Breakfast supports cognitive performance and sustained energy for students. Skipping breakfast is associated with reduced attention span, working memory, and academic performance in the morning. A balanced breakfast combining complex carbohydrates (oats, whole grain bread) with protein (eggs, yogurt, nuts) provides stable glucose to the brain and delays hunger until midday.
