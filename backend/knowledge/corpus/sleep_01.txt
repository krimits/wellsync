Adults need 7–9 hours of sleep per night for optimal health and cognitive performance. Consistently sleeping fewer than 7 hours is associated with increased risk of obesity, cardiovascular disease, and impaired immune function. Even a single night of insufficient sleep reduces next-day reaction time, decision-making, and emotional regulation.
