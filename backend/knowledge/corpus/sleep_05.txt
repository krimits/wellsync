Napping can partially offset sleep deficiency. A 20–30 minute nap taken between 13:00–15:00 improves alertness and motor performance without causing sleep inertia or disrupting nighttime sleep. Naps longer than 45 minutes may lead to grogginess and should be avoided when trying to correct nighttime sleep patterns.
