Blue light from screens suppresses melatonin secretion, delaying the onset of sleep. Exposure to bright screens within 60 minutes of bedtime can shift the circadian rhythm by 1–3 hours. Using night mode or blue-light-blocking glasses in the evening, or avoiding screens entirely after 22:00, helps preserve natural melatonin levels and sleep onset.
