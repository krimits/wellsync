After a poor night's sleep, reducing training intensity is recommended. On days following less than 6 hours of sleep, the risk of injury during high-intensity training increases significantly due to impaired reaction time and reduced muscular coordination. Light activity such as walking, yoga, or a short low-intensity ride is preferable to heavy lifting or interval training.
