Chronic stress impairs physical recovery and immune function. Elevated cortisol from prolonged psychological stress suppresses muscle protein synthesis, increases muscle breakdown, elevates resting heart rate, and reduces immune function. On high-stress days, prioritizing sleep, reducing training intensity, and incorporating brief relaxation practices (5–10 minutes of breathing or mindfulness) helps regulate the cortisol response.
