Diaphragmatic breathing (slow, deep belly breathing) is a clinically validated method for reducing acute stress. Inhaling for 4 counts, holding for 4, and exhaling for 6–8 counts activates the parasympathetic nervous system within 2–3 minutes, reducing heart rate, blood pressure, and cortisol. Box breathing (4-4-4-4) is widely used by athletes and military personnel for rapid stress regulation.
