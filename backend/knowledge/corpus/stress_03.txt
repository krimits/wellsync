Nature exposure and outdoor activity reduce stress hormones measurably. Spending 20–30 minutes in a natural environment (park, forest, outdoor space with greenery) lowers salivary cortisol by 15–20% and reduces self-reported stress levels. On high-stress days, even a brief outdoor walk is more restorative than indoor exercise at the same intensity.
