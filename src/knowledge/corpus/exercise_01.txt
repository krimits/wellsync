Adults should aim for at least 150–300 minutes of moderate-intensity aerobic activity per week, or 75–150 minutes of vigorous-intensity activity. This is the foundation of the ACSM physical activity guidelines and is associated with reduced risk of chronic disease, improved mood, and better cognitive function. Even short bouts of 10 minutes contribute to the weekly total.
