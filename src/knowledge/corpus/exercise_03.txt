Rate of Perceived Exertion (RPE) is a validated subjective measure of exercise intensity. On the 1–10 Borg CR10 scale, RPE 4–5 corresponds to moderate intensity (aerobic zone, sustainable conversation), RPE 6–7 to vigorous intensity, and RPE 8–10 to near-maximal effort. Training predominantly at RPE 4–6 builds aerobic base; higher intensities are reserved for 1–2 sessions per week.
