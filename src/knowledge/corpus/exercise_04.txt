Recovery days are as important as training days. Muscle protein synthesis peaks 24–48 hours after resistance training and requires adequate rest to complete. Including 1–2 full rest days or active recovery days (light walking, stretching, yoga) per week prevents overtraining syndrome, reduces injury risk, and leads to greater long-term fitness gains.
