Protein is essential for muscle repair and adaptation after resistance training. The ISSN recommends 1.4–2.0 g of protein per kg of body weight per day for active individuals seeking to maintain or build muscle mass. Protein intake should be distributed across 3–4 meals (0.3–0.4 g/kg per meal) to maximize muscle protein synthesis throughout the day.
