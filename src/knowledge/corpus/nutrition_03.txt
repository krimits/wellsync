Hydration directly affects both cognitive and physical performance. Even mild dehydration (1–2% body weight loss) impairs concentration, short-term memory, and mood, while reducing exercise capacity by up to 10%. The general recommendation is 35–45 ml of fluid per kg of body weight per day, increased by 500–750 ml for every hour of exercise. Plain water is sufficient for sessions under 60 minutes.
