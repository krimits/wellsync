Post-exercise nutrition accelerates recovery. Consuming a meal or snack with a 3:1 ratio of carbohydrates to protein within 30–60 minutes after training replenishes muscle glycogen and initiates muscle protein synthesis. Suitable options: Greek yogurt with fruit, chicken with rice, or a protein shake with banana. Delaying post-workout nutrition by more than 2 hours reduces the anabolic response.
