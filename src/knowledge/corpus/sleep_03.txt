Exercise improves sleep quality but timing matters. Moderate aerobic exercise performed at least 3 hours before bedtime significantly improves sleep onset latency and total sleep time. High-intensity training within 2 hours of bedtime can delay sleep onset due to elevated cortisol and core body temperature.
