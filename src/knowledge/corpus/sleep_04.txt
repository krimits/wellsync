Sleep debt accumulates and cannot be fully "paid back" in a single recovery night. Chronic partial sleep restriction (6 hours/night for two weeks) produces cognitive deficits equivalent to 48 hours of total sleep deprivation. Recovery requires multiple consecutive full-sleep nights. Prioritizing consistent bedtime is more effective than occasional long-sleep catch-up sessions.
