Mindfulness practice — paying deliberate attention to the present moment without judgment — reduces chronic stress and improves emotional regulation. As few as 8 weeks of mindfulness practice (10–20 minutes/day) produces measurable reductions in anxiety, depression scores, and cortisol reactivity. Apps such as free guided meditation resources provide structured beginner programs for students.
